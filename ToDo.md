# TODO: Release 0.2.2;
## Additions:
Release 0.2.2 will introduce new features to optimize the usage of screen space by printing files in columns and enhance the program's speed. The update will also include a new library to handle colorization specifically tailored to the project's needs, eliminating the need for external libraries like "chrono".

## Installation Updates:
### install.sh:

    Release 0.2.2 will ship with an install.sh script that will compile and install the program in /usr/local/bim. 
    Will add an autocompletion file to /usr/share/zsh/vendor-completions/.
    The installer will also be able to automatically configure color settings for all users in etc/ and for specific users in their home directory's .list file.
